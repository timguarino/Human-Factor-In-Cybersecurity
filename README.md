# Human Factor In Cybersecurity
Companies invest a lot of money into cybersecurity technology. They will ensure the latest and greatest tools and processes to avoid any vulnerabilities, only to be thwarted by the inevitable weakest link - humans. The research on the Psychology of Human Error, conducted by Stamford University in 2020, revealed that human error was the cause of 88% of cybersecurity data breaches. However, according to the 2023 Thales Global Security Study involving nearly 3,000 companies, human error remains a significant factor, causing 55% of data breaches​ (SWEENEY, 2023)​. 

## Case Studies
to add

## Social Engineering
- Human Manipulation
- Tricking individuals into revealing information or granting access
- Depends on the victim's willingness to trust the attacker

### Methods
- Physical - Tailgating
  - Following behind victim into a restricted area - willing or unwilling
  - "Hey, it's Jim from accounting, we met at the holiday party. Oh yeah, I forgot my keycard at home"
- Pretexting
  - Create a fake scenario to gain trust
  - "I'm caling from IT, we've had some issues with your account, I need your password to fix it"
- Baiting
  - Luring and temptation
  - Leaving a flashdrive for someone to find, they will get curious and plug it in to see what's on it
  - May have something interesting on it to reduce suspicion that it was malicious
- Phishing
  - Sending fake emails, texts, etc.
  - Pose as legitimate trusted entity
  - Attempt to obtain sensitive information (passwords, credit card information)
  - Generic, sent to many people hoping that one will bite
- Spear Phishing
  - A phishing attempt targeted at an individual
  - Tailored to get the highest change of success of success
  - Includes personal details: name, boss' name, job, likes, hobbies, etc.

## The Attack Simulation
- Use social engineering to find the most popular video games among a group
  - Discord groups
  - Local game clubs
- Create a fake website to offer special Black Friday deals on those games
  - A sense of urgency to force the victim to act quickly without thinking too much
